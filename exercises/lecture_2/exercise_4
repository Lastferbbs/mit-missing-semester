Exercise:

Your task is to write a command that recursively finds all HTML files in the folder and makes a zip with them.
 Note that your command should work even if the files have spaces (hint: check -d flag for xargs).


Answer:

find . -name "*.html" -print0 | xargs -0 tar cfz html.tar
tar -xf html.gz --transform='s/.*\///'

--transform get rid of subdirectories
quite useful
