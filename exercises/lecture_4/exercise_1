Find the number of words (in /usr/share/dict/words) that contain at least three as and don’t have a 's ending.
What are the three most common last two letters of those words?
sed’s y command, or the tr program, may help you with case insensitivity.
How many of those two-letter combinations are there? And for a challenge: which combinations do not occur?

Answer:
cat /usr/share/dict/words | rg "[Aa](\w*)a(\w*)a(\w*)[^'s]$" | rg -o "..$" | sort | uniq -c | sort -nk1,1

first ripgrep regex:
[Aa] - looking for first occurrence of a (also takes care of big A at the beginning of the word)
(\w*) - 0 or more words characters
a - second occurrence of a
...
[^'s]$ - make sure word doesn't have "'s" ending - ^ excludes 's from the range
