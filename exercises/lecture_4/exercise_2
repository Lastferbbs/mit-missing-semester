Find your average, median, and max system boot time over the last ten boots.
Use journalctl on Linux and log show on macOS, and look for log timestamps near the beginning and end of each boot.


Answer:

journalctl | grep 'systemd\[1\]: Startup finished' | tail -n10 | awk '{print $(NF)}' | st-console <(rg -o "\d+\.\d+") --median --mean

0. open journalctl
1. grep for startup log
2. get last 10 enteries
3. get last column with awk
4. calculate median and mean with st-console and process substitution (also cleaning numbers with rg)
